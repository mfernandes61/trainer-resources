Files to support teaching the new Python course

To collapse the cells on page loading you need to install nbextensions:
conda install conda-forge::jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
Then 
  	jupyter contrib nbextension install --user

In the notebook under settings ensure that 'enable extension manager' is ticked
Next under 'view' collapse all code.

Whilst teaching click on the trailing ellipses ... to expand that code section.

I have also created PDF versions for those who like to teach from printed aide-memoires.
Latter can also be used as class handouts.

For Plotnine - this is a handy resource for students to further develop their ability to use it in creating graphs https://plotnine.org/gallery/ . Not quite as good as the R graph gallery that I send my R students to learn more advanced ggplot but still pretty good with example graphs and the code that produced them.
